A simple batter and catcher report generator from Trackman CSV data. This is built specifically for the University of Houston. You can adjust it to what you need for your specific teams. 

Ball placement in zones are not particularly accurate, mainly on height.

To run, open StatGen.py and download the required libraries. You need FPDF, TKinter, Numpy, Pandas, Collections->DefaultDict, Math, Sys, and OS if not already included. Select the CSV file you want, name the file you wish to output, then generate the PDFs.
